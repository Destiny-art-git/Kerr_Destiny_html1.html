            <strong> My tribute goes out to those that dedicate their life to help animals in need. I
                believe animals can help fill a hole in your heart, help with depression and anxiety and bring joy and
                laughter to your life. I will always adopt, not shop. I hope that others can see
                how
                much of a difference we can make by giving dogs and cats a second chance and a loving home. Below are 2
                organizations and 1 club located in Utah dedicated to making a difference.</strong>

            <h2 class="h2-1">Nuzzles and Co</h2>
            <p>Located in Summit County Utah and started by a group of volunteers, Nuzzles and Co have found homes for
                over 22,000 pets. In their 16,000 square foot Resuce Ranch they have a large community cat room and
                large outdoor enrichment runs for dogs to exercise and play. My family has become very fond of Nuzzles
                and Co because we adopted our dog Boba there a few months ago. He has filled out hearts with joy. If
                you would like to adopt an animal or donate to them click the link to their website below.

                <h2>Best Friends Animal Society</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Starting in the 1990's, Best Friends has been a leader in making Utah a
                no-kill state. In 2000,
                they began a program called No More Homeless Pets (now called Best Friends NKUT). Their initiative was
                to bring together resuce programs, shelters, goverment and businesses
                to help save animals by making adopting more accessible. The program has reduced the number of animals
                killed each year. Before the program began 46,000 animals were killed in shelters in Utah every
                year. By
                2018 that number had been reduced to under 3,500. Learn More about their amazing work by visiting their
                website. </p>

            <h2 class="h2-3">Help Save the Animals</h2>
            <p>This is my biggest inspiration and closets to my heart. Created by my daughter, Aria, when she was 5
                years old. Her love for animals inspired her to create her own club. Aria began by recruiting her
                cousins. Together they have meetings about how to help animals and how to get their word out. She
                hopes to make Help
                Save the Animals into an orgainization that
                will truely make a differnce. For now, she will continue to make and hold up signs hoping to bring
                awarness for her furry friends. Please check out their website.</p>
